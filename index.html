      <h2>About PAKDD-GLFM 2025</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          In PAKDD-GLFM 2025 (Workshop on Graph Learning with Foundation Models @ PAKDD 2025),
          we aim to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to
          discuss and advance the state-of-the-art in graph machine learning with foundation models.
        </p>
        <p>
          Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) represent a cutting-edge approach in graph machine learning
          that integrates the power of large-scale foundation models with graph structures. Specifically,
          GFMs are designed to effectively capture complex relationships and dependencies present in
          graph-structured data, such as social networks, biological networks, and knowledge graphs.
          By learning from diverse and extensive graph data, GFMs show emergent capabilities that
          significantly enhance performance across various, even unseen, downstream tasks, such as
          node/graph classification and link prediction.
        </p>
        <p>
          As graphs continue to be a powerful tool for modeling real-world interactions, the development
          of GFMs is becoming increasingly important with real-world applications spanning diverse fields,
          including detecting anomalies in social networks, drug discovery through graph-based molecular
          classification, enhancing recommendation systems for personalized content, and strengthening
          cybersecurity by identifying vulnerabilities in network structures. Again, the emergent capabilities
          of GFMs allow them to adapt to new applications, generalizing across diverse domains and uncovering
          insights beyond the reach of traditional models.

        </p>

        <p>
          Paper submission must be in English. All papers will be double-blind reviewed by the Program Committee based on
          technical quality, relevance to the GLFM workshop, originality, significance, and presentation quality. All paper
          submissions will be handled electronically. The author list and order cannot be changed after the paper is submitted.
          Papers that do not comply with the Submission Policy will be rejected without review.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each submitted paper must include an abstract up to 200 words. Each submitted paper must be no longer than 12 pages
          (including references, appendices, etc.). Authors must use Springer LNCS/LNAI manuscript submission guidelines and
          formatting template for their submissions. All papers must be submitted electronically through the GLFM's CMT paper
          submission system in PDF format only.
